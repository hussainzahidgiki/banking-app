# banking-app
A command-line banking application written in Java
The goal was to write a command-line program, in Java, to act as a simple banking application, with bank accounts. Each bank account has a name (the person holding the account), a balance, and a list of transactions. List of features:
1. The ability to list all bank accounts’ names in the system – there should be at least two in the program when it is first run.
2. The ability to view an individual bank account with its balance and list of transactions.
3. The ability to add new transactions to a bank account’s list of transactions – this should also affect the account’s balance.
4. The ability to remove any bank account from the system.
5. The ability to create new bank accounts, with an initial name and balance that the user may provide.
